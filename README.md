# Gate-Pass-Card-With-QR
I have made an employee card ,that contains some basic details. There is a QR at the below of the card. Scan the QR &amp; if you are scanning it at 10 AM or between 12 Am-10 Am,you can see the message 'Welcome to work!" within an alert box. By any chance if you are late by 1 or more minutes then you can see the message "Sorry, you are late!" .
